### debugging ts

- use docs , they usually have ts example of library
- use chatgpt - suprisingly good - very very very good, can process large chunks of code and context. so good that it's worth the first choice over thinking with your head.
- because in ts it's sometimes all about knowing the custom types that are exported from package - which we can't know unless we have gone through the documentation of over exact use case (which is rare) thorougly. ex : GridColDef,GridCellParams
- hover tricks
- creating and editing a types.d.ts file
- don't quit - exorcise
- module augmentation using type.d.ts and spefying the necessary config in tsconfig so those types get picked up
