### debugging ts

- use docs , they usually have ts example of library
- use chatgpt - suprisingly good - very very very good, can process large chunks of code and context.
- hover tricks
- creating and editing a types.d.ts file
- don't quit - exorcise
- module augmentation using type.d.ts and spefying the necessary config in tsconfig so those types get picked up
